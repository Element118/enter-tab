# enter-tab

EnterTab is a programming language where about writing documents.

There is a bit of logic when you press tab. It sends the character after the cursor to the next position which is a multiple of the tab length. Usually, that can be 2, 4 or 8 spaces.

EnterTab aims to harness this logic to create programs. We aim to make this a Turing-Complete programming lanugage.
